# VBA-challenge

Script to run through multiple excel sheets and get various statistical analysis. All the data is categorized by the Ticker in the stock market. The analysis is done on these points:

A) Yearly change

B) percent change

C) total stock volume

For the Challenges portion:

D) Greatest % increase

E) Greatest % decrease

F) Greatest Total Volume

Time it takes to run the script is ~10-15 seconds as everything is done on the first stepthrough of each sheet's iteration as to save total time. We keep following variables for each value to keep a track of the challenges rather than traversing after we are done inputting data to the sheet. This way we take care of two birds with one stone. This assigment was interesting as I learned a few more concepts for stocks as well as how to manipulate Excel sheets with vba thoroughly. For more information the homework prompt is included in the repo. Thanks!

**Note** since the excel files were too big to put in the repo, In the [my_submission](https://github.com/slobanwala1/VBA-challenge/tree/master/my_submission) folder are the snapshots for how it would look when the script is ran. Also the script is there and in [Resources](https://github.com/slobanwala1/VBA-challenge/tree/master/Instructions/Resources).


## Here are the snapshots by year as examples of how it looks after the script has ran:
